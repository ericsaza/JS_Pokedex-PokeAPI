# JS_Pokedex-PokeAPI
I have created a Pokedex with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (using the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)).

# Attributes:
- Intuitive and easy to use user interface.
- You can search for pokemon from the 9 generations that there are so far.
- Simple design.
- Is responsive.

# Screenshots:
Upon entering you will see this screen that has a select for you to choose a generation.

Here, for example, I am looking for the 3rd generation pokemon (Some in shiny).
