# Pokedex-using-PokeAPI
I have created a Pokedex with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (using the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)).

# Attributes:
- Intuitive and easy to use user interface.
- You can search for pokemon from the 9 generations that there are so far.
- Simple design.
- Is responsive.
- You can search your favourite pokémon.

# Screenshots:
Upon entering you will see this screen that has a select for you to choose a generation.

Here, for example, I am looking for the 3rd generation pokemon (Some in shiny).

You can also go looking for pokémones in the pokedex and see them.
